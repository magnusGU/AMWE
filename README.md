# Chalmers Bokbytarapp by AMWE (Group 10)
The buying and selling of course literature between students at Chalmers University is today mainly done through different facebook groups. The plan is to build an android application on which you can buy or sell your course books. The application will allow sellers to post their books for free and buyers to search for their desired books and contact sellers if they find something desirable.
